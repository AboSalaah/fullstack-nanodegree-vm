# Item Catalog
An application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

## Getting Started
### prerequisites
Logs Analysis uses a virtual machine (VM) to run an SQL database server and a web app that uses it.

Logs Analysis requires the following to run:

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) the software that actually runs the virtual machine.
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) is the software that configures the VM and lets you share files between your host computer and the VM's filesystem.


### Installing
* First clone the project and virtal machine repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/AboSalaah/fullstack-nanodegree-vm.git
```
### Running the code
* Change to a folder called vagrant inside the cloned repository
```
$ cd ../cloned_repository/vagrant
```
* Start the virtual machine.
```
$ vagrant up
```
This will cause Vagrant to download the Linux operating system and install it.

* run ```vagrant ssh``` to log in to 
your newly installed Linux VM.
```
$ vagrant ssh
```

* Change folder to /vagrant to access the portion that is shared between your machine and the virtual machine
```
$ cd /vagrant
```
* Change folder to /catalog folder which contains the project installed and run the server
```
cd .../catalog
python server.py
```
